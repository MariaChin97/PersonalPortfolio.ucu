        <h1>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">I am Ma. Luisa T. Pajarillo, 24 years old born on August 8, 1997 in Manila and now I am in Sta. Maria, Pangasinan in my mother’s home town. I graduated from Isabelo delos Reyes Elementary School in Tondo, Manila year 2009 and later on studied at Tondo High School for two years only because my parents got separated in 2011. I continue my studies and graduated at Tayug National High School in Tayug, Pangasinan in 2013. I also studied in AMA Computer Learning Center as a Computer System Design and Programming student at Sampaloc, Manila but unfortunately I didn’t finish my course because of some personal issues in my family and I don’t want my course but not to boost I also became a Dean’s Lister even if I don’t want my course and later, after 5 years of being a wandered teen and hard headed child I’ve decided to continue my study here at Urdaneta City University. Now, I am a second year irregular student turning third year next semester and I thank god because he gave me a mother who have a good heart and have a lot of patience in her children. I am a fur mother of three kittens that I adopted in the street. My hobbies are eating, watching k-dramas and annoying my cats but even though I annoy them I cherish them. I choose BSIT because my dream is to become a Software Developer.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">In 10 years, I see myself living with my mom with stable job in a company as Software Developer. My mother is an OFW that is why I always give my best to study so that, she can come home. My goal in life is to give happiness to my family by giving them the best I can give as a daughter, niece, sister and a beautiful aunt and plus po pala. I don’t want to bear a child.</p>
